# AssignmentGenerator
Creates randomized Java JUnit testing assignments for a number of students which you can set.

Fill the file "studentNumbers.txt" with a list of students that you have. (Default values are provided). After running the program a folder will be created for each student, each with its unique questions and unique solutions. 
 
Directly inside the folder will be A1Test.java and A2Test.java. Both these files have a list of test cases where 3 inputs to a function need to produce the desired output. 
 
The folder inside those folders called "se2s03" will contain A1.java and A2.java. These are the solutions for that student. Have the student try and come up with the solution on their own.
 
Running Instructions
---
You can compile the cpp file, or run the provided executable. It will create a directory for each student listed in the "studentNumbers.txt" file, which you can modify.
